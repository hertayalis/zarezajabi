face and his voice cracking with emotion, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aric Hutchinson spoke to ABC’s “Good Morning America”</a> about the April 28 collision that turned his life upside down.</p><p>“I remember waking up. It’s kind of foggy, out of sorts,” Hutchinson told ABC correspondent Eva Pilgrim. “I could see my mom’s face, and you could just tell that something was wrong. I asked her, ‘Where’s Sam? Where’s Sam?’ And that’s when she told me there was an incident and that Sam didn’t make it.”</p><p>Aric, 36, and Samantha, 34, were riding in a golf cart with family members from their wedding reception at Folley Beach when a Toyota Camry allegedly doing 40 mph above the speed limit rear-ended their slow-moving vehicle.</p><p>The impact sent the golf cart flying 100 yards and rolling over several times.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Aric Hutchinson gave an emotional interview to ABC’s “Good Morning America” about last month’s crash that killed his wife just hours after their wedding. <span class=credit>ABC</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Hutchinson revealed that he initially did not know that his wife, Samantha, was killed when he woke up in the hospital. <span class=credit>9th Judicial Circuit, South Carolina</span></figure><p>The bride, who was still in her wedding dress, died at the scene.</p><p>The groom was <a href=#>hospitalized with a brain injury</a> and multiple broken bones in his face and body.</p><h2 class=block-info-box__heading>Everything you need to know about Sam Hutchinson's tragic death</h2><p><strong>Who was Sam Hutchinson?</strong></p><p>The 34-year-old was tragically <a href=#>killed by a drunk driver as she was leaving her wedding reception</a> with her husband, Aric, who suffered severe injuries.</p><p>Hutchinson was reportedly <a href=#>killed by Jamie Lee Komoroski,</a> who was <a href=#>three-times over the legal limit, </a>while the bride and groom exited the wedding reception on a golf cart.</p><p>Hutchinson was declared dead at the scene.</p><p>Aric <a href=#>filed a wrongful death suit</a> against the alleged drunk driver and the bars that he says over served her before the horrific incident.</p><p><strong>What will happen to Jamie Lee Komoroski?</strong></p><p>Komoroski, 25, plowed into the Hutchinsons’ golf cart while driving around 65 miles per hour, according to Folly Beach police.</p><p>The driver reportedly smelled of alcohol but refused to take a sobriety test.</p><p>She was charged with three felony DUIs resulting in great bodily injury or death and one count of reckless homicide. She is facing up to 25 years in jail.</p><p>Despite <a href=#>alleged special treatment in jail,</a> Komoroski reportedly has griped about everything, from the food to not being allowed to hold the TV remote control — and not getting an exercise mat to do crunches.</p><p>Komoroski has started <a href=#>outlining her plans for her own wedding </a>in a tearful jail phone call with her father, obtained exclusively by The Post.</p><p>Another victim, the groom’s relative Ben Garrett, was also seriously hurt.</p><p>Hutchinson said he does not remember the moment of impact — although he wishes he did.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Samantha was pronounced dead at the scene at Folley Beach, South Carolina, after the golf cart she was in was rear-ended by a speeding car. <span class=credit>Folly Beach Police Department</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Aric survived but suffered multiple serious injuries, including a brain injury and broken bones. <span class=credit>GoFundMe/Folly Beach Police/MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hutchinson, 36, broke down in tears while speaking about losing his wife to a suspected drunk driver. <span class=credit>ABC</span></figure><p>“The last thing I remember [Samantha] saying was she wanted the night to never end,” he recounted through sobs.</p><p>The driver of the Toyota, 25-year-old Jamie Komoroski, has been charged with three counts of felony DUI resulting in death or injury and one count of reckless homicide.</p><p>Hutchinson, who has been recovering at home for more than a week, spoke movingly of his joyful memories from the night of the wedding — before the crash changed everything.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hutchinson said his mother was the one who told him that Samantha died in the accident. <span class=credit>Facebook / Michael D Peifer</span></figure><p>“I’m still trying to wrap my head around it — that night going from an all-time high to an all-time low,” he said. “It’s pretty rough to comprehend.”</p><p>Hutchinson recalled the feeling of being surrounded by family and friends who had traveled from all over the country to celebrate his and Samantha’s nuptials.</p><p>“She was so happy,” he said of his late bride.</p><p>When asked if he had a message for the driver, Hutchinson said, “She stole something.
