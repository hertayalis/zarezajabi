He uses his ability quite creatively and has mastered all 3 forms of Haki. In a fight against Itachi, the current Luffy in his Gear Four is in a totally different class from Itachi. <b>This Fight will be an easy win for Luffy.</b></p><h2>Can Luffy be put in a genjutsu?</h2><p>9 Can’t Beat: Luffy Has Nothing To Counter Sasuke Uchiha</p><p>He can also use Genjutsu to trap Luffy in an illusion or use Human Path to rip out his soul. Luffy would have no defense against most of Sasuke’s techniques.</p><h2>Who can beat Itachi in anime?</h2><p>Jiraiya. Jiraiya was an exceptionally competent shinobi, and he was the only member of the Legendary Sannin who could actually beat Itachi. He was trained by the Third Hokage, and learned how to use Sage Mode while training with the toads of Mount Myoboku.</p><h2>Can Luffy defeat Madara?</h2><p>No. While Gear 5 Luffy and Luffy in general in powerful, he can’t deal with someone like Madara. Madara has better attacks, better defense, and more had so yeah.</p><h2>Can Naruto defeat Luffy?</h2><p>Taking Naruto’s different Modes into consideration, he’d be the clear winner during a battle with Luffy. It’s likely that Naruto would be stronger and more powerful than anything Luffy has ever had to face in the world of One Piece, with Luffy’s current Gear 5 paling in comparison.</p><h2>What if Itachi Played Ball</h2><h2>Can gear 5 beat Naruto?</h2><p>Like many battles in anime, the strongest fighter doesn’t always win. Under some extraordinary circumstances, Luffy’s Gear 5 could potentially beat Naruto’s Baryon Mode. However, at the end of the day, Baryon Mode is stronger and faster than what fans have seen of Gear 5 so far.</p><h2>Can gear 5 Luffy beat Sasuke?</h2><p>Luffy absolutely dominates this fight. Faster, he’s stronger, and he’s got better hacks and abilities than Sasuke. On top of that, most of the powers and abilities of the kid that Mikoto.</p><h2>Can gear 5 Luffy beat Goku?</h2><p>Luffy’s Gear Fifth Is Strong, But It Can’t Beat Goku Yet</p><p>Goku’s efficiency and ability with ki attacks such as the Kamehameha also put him in a league of his own as one of the most powerful Dragon Ball characters in existence.</p><h2>Can Boruto defeat Luffy?</h2><p>Luffy could easily dodge or redirect the rasengan or kunai/shuriiken with haki, leaving Boruto with no chance. Luffy simple holds all the advantages in power, speed and even physiology. Future Boruto is debatable however.</p><h2>Can Zoro beat Sasuke?</h2><p>But where most of his companions are at least somewhat superhuman due to eating a Devil Fruit, Zoro is just a regular combatant. Sasuke’s talent, training, and Sharingan would probably be enough to overpower him, especially since Zoro gets disoriented easily.</p><h2>Can Goku beat Itachi?</h2><p>Itachi is literally a living god, he’s taken on multiple beings with a single thought. Goku wins this easily. Goku would move faster than Itachi could see even with the Mangekyo Sharingan. Goku can ignore all of Itachi’s attacks because they’re not strong enough for him to be harmed by them at all.</p><h2>Can Itachi beat Boruto?</h2><p>In the anime, he cannot: Itachi’s strength is using the Mangekyo Sharingan (susanoo, amaterasu and tsukuyomi) and the use of high level genjutsu. Boruto, he has the Jougan (which he can barely use) to anticipate his enemy’s movements. However, one amaterasu and Boruto will not know how to counter that and it’s done.</p><h2>Can kid Naruto beat Itachi?</h2><p>Yes, yes he can. Naruto now is too strong for Itachi. One big and overhyped argument in favor of Itachi is his Tsukuyomi.</p><h2>Can Goku break genjutsu?</h2><p>yes they can technically work on goku, but they likely wouldn’t last for very long. normal genjutsu wouldn’t work as goku does not have chakra. ocular genjutsu (the sharingan genjutsus) would work as they do not need chakra, however goku would easily break out of said genjutsu.</p><h2>Who can betray Luffy?</h2><p>While One Piece has many superb side characters, Big News Morgans just proved why he is the best of them by betraying Luffy and his crew.</p><h2>Can Luffy beat Kakashi?</h2><p>Luffy is a lot more enduring and a lot more heavy hitting than Kakashi in his current form without Sharingan. Even the strongest form of electricity such as Raikiri will be ineffective. Through Haki and Rubber: Luffy wins.</p><h2>Can Naruto defeat Goku?</h2><p>Although Naruto’s physical strength isn’t on the level of Goku’s, he can certainly do well against him in a fight. With Naruto’s limitless chakra and other such overpowered abilities at his disposal, like the Six Paths Sage Mode, Naruto would be able to hold his own, at least for a while.</p><h2>Can Zoro beat Goku?</h2><p>As skilled as Zoro is though, he would never be able to cut Goku’s body, in fact, Goku could shatter each sword like it was made of glass.</p><h2>Who wins Naruto or Luffy?</h2><p>Ultimately, however, Naruto Uzumaki is the stronger of the two – at least for now. Naruto Uzumaki is stronger because he has already reached his endgame in every regard. He has fully embraced Kurama’s power and reached the end of his own anime, while Luffy’s adventure is still ongoing.</p><h2>Can Shanks defeat Goku?</h2><p>There are a few things that make Shanks a legitimately formidable opponent, most of which are really useful against Goku. There’s the fact that he’s probably the second-best swordsman of all time since he used to be a rival of Dracula Mihawk.</p><h2>Can Goku beat Superman?</h2><p>In-universe, Suppaman is Dragon Ball’s Superman, and it’s been confirmed that he can’t even match the likes of General Blue. This means that Goku is far stronger than his universe’s ‘Superman’, proving once and for all that Goku is superior within the confines of Dragon Ball continuity.</p><h2>Can Luffy beat Shanks?</h2><p>Luffy has not surpassed Shanks just yet, otherwise, their future fight would hold no significant value. Luffy is close to Shanks in terms of power and it is only after their fight that he will officially be able to call himself stronger than Shanks. For now, Red Hair reigns supreme.</p><h2>Can Sakura beat Luffy?</h2><p>Luffy would murk her with better speed, endurance, strength, haki, gears, stamina, and skill. She also can’t hurt him due to only using blunt force attacks. Hello anime fan. As seeing that luffy is made out of rubber sakura’s Monster strength will be useless since luffy won’t feel any damage.</p><h2>Can adult Sasuke beat Luffy?</h2><p>Unfortunately, Luffy’s rubber body doesn’t make him impervious to fire, so Sasuke is already stronger thanks to his Amaterasu, and his Susanoo’s arrows are strong enough to pierce Luffy’s body.</p><h2>Can Naruto defeat Sasuke?</h2><p>While Sasuke had the power of the Rinnegan, along with nine Tailed Beasts that he had captured, Naruto had just half of Kurama within him. Despite that, he was able to keep up with Sasuke and even defeat him eventually, as evident from when Sasuke admitted to having lost to him in the end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5wr8CnZKKskZi1qnnDnp2emaRiubayxbJm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./desiigner-net-worth-details-about-wife-lyrics-panda-songs-insta-age.html>&#171;&nbsp;Desiigner Net Worth : Details About Wife, lyrics, Panda, Songs, Insta, Age - SarkariResult</a>
