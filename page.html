I got the idea from a Vietnamese restaurant just a short walk away from our house. Their mushroom pho is has a richly spiced broth and loads of slurpy noodles. It’s hot, flavorful, and comforting, but it still feels nice and fresh. After enjoying bowls upon bowls of their delicious soup, I’ve finally made my own vegetarian pho recipe to share with all of you. What is Pho?

Make fancy ice in the shape of&nbsp;hearts&nbsp;or&nbsp;x’s and o’s&nbsp;–&nbsp;how cute?! 2. Think about some fun memories you’ve shared over drinks.

It was years ago at&nbsp;Native Foods&nbsp;where the Native Nachos were a revelation to us. They weren’t a snack, they were our dinner late one night. They were piled high with taco “meat,” black beans, cashew cheese (a crazy concept at the time), salsa, and guacamole… we scarfed them down saying (with our mouths full) “how are these vegan?!” I came home with their cookbook and every night later that week, I made nachos.
