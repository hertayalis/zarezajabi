Siblings, Family, Net Worth</h1><div id=sub-header>July 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span>In February 2014, Michael Jordans and his wife Yvette Prieto Jordan welcomed his twin daughters, Victoria and Ysabel Jordan, worldwide.&nbsp;The twins were conceived in West Palm Beach, Florida, and they arrived exactly 10 months after Michael and Yvette officially tied the knot after a six-year relationship that began at a Miami club.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ysabel Jordan Twins</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Jordan twins, Victoria and Ysabel Jordan, are very identical.&nbsp;Their parents publicly announced they were expecting in November 2013, although it was not revealed that they were expecting twins.</span></p><p><span>Since they started dating, the couple (Jordan and Yvette) had been victims of constant pressure from the paparazzi.&nbsp;Thus, the births of Ysabel and Victoria forced the couple to stay away from the media or any such publicity, doing their best to raise their children from the interference of the general public.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ysabel – First Name Meaning Origin</span></strong></h2><p><span>The name Ysabel is related to names such as Isabel, Yzabel and Elizabeth.&nbsp;In French, the name Ysabel means devoted to God.&nbsp;It is also similar to that of the Italian version which means Consecrated to God.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ysabel Jordan Father</span></strong></h2><p><span>There is no doubt that Ysabel’s father, Michael Jordan has always been considered the greatest basketball player of all time.&nbsp;Jordan who is currently 6 feet 6 inches (1.98m) shares the same birth month (born February 17, 1963) as her twin daughters.</span></p><p><span>He currently owns the CharlotteHornets NBA team.&nbsp;Before retiring, Jordan had played 15 seasons in the NBA with the Chicago Bulls and the Washington Wizards.&nbsp;Jordan married his first wife, Juanita Vanoy, in September 1989. They both have a daughter and two sons.</span></p><p><span>After filing for divorce twice, the couple was finally formalized in December 2006, and Juanita Vanoy was awarded $168 million, which was considered the biggest celebrity settlement at the time.</span></p><p><span>On Christmas 2011, Jordan proposed to his current wife and mother of twins Yvette Prieto.&nbsp;Two years later, the engaged couple took him to Bethesday-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church where they were married.</span></p><p><strong><span>Michael Jordan Awards</span></strong></p><p><span>Here’s a look at the awards Michael Jordan has won over the years.&nbsp;We think these are his most prestigious awards and should be at the top of the list.</span></p><ul><li><span>He won the NBA championship 6 times</span></li><li><span>He was not only the NBA Most Valuable Player five times, but also the NBA Most Valuable Player in a Finals six times.</span></li><li><span>He won the NBA Slam Dunk contest twice.</span></li><li><span>He won the NBA championship 10 times.</span></li></ul><h2><strong><span>Ysabel Jordan&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Mother</span></strong></h2><p><span>Yvette Prieto, the mother of Ysabel Jordan is a model from Cuba.&nbsp;She married Michael Jordan in Palm Beach, Florida where their twins were conceived in April 2013. Ysabel Jordan is 16 years younger than her husband, Jordan.&nbsp;The pair met while having fun at a club in 2008.</span></p><p><span>Although the couple only got married in 2013, they had already been living together since 2009.&nbsp;Their wedding was performed by some of the biggest names in music and her wedding dress was designed by J’Aton Couture.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Siblings and family</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ysabel Jordan and her twin sister have joined the family of three (Jeffrey Jordan, 28, Marcus Jordan, 26, and Jasmine, 24).&nbsp;This makes a total of 5 Jordan children (2 boys and 3 girls) from the two wives.</span></p><p><span>Jordan’s first wife, Juanita Vanoy, is the mother of three adult children, who divorced in 2006 after a 17-year marriage record.</span></p><p><strong><span>Cousins:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Alexis Jordan, Justin Jordan</span></p><p><strong><span>Grandparents:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;James R. Jordan, Sr., Deloris Jordan, Carlos Prieto, Maria Prieto</span></p><h2><span>Grandfather – James Raymond Jordan</span></h2><p><span>James R. Jordan was the father of Michael Jordan.&nbsp;He died in 1993, before Ysabel Jordan was born.&nbsp;James was known to be a huge baseball fan, inspiring his son Michael to become a professional player.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Michael went the basketball route;&nbsp;his father nevertheless supported him.</span></p><p><strong><span>Uncles:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;James Jordan Jr., Larry Jordan</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net value</span></strong></h2><p><span>While it’s common to see celebrity kids making money from an early age through endorsements and other deals, Ysabel Jordan didn’t, mostly because her parents tried to protect her. media and paparazzi that constantly accompany their celebrity status.&nbsp;Therefore, Ysabel Jordan’s net worth currently depends on her father’s achievements over the years.</span></p><p><span>His father, Michael Jordan, is currently bringing in around $1.4 billion from his basketball career, endorsement deals, and other investments.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGixo5avpriMo6arnJGjeri1yqJkra%2BZo8BussCtn56qXaK8tbTEq2SsoZKhtq%2Bz0madmqWZocZuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./greys-anatomy-fans-think-kevin-mckidd-could-have-been-great-hayes-instead-of-owen-hunt-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;'Grey's Anatomy' Fans Think Kevin McKidd Could Have Been a Great Hayes Instead of Owen Hunt</a>
